## Idea
2 collaborative robots build a tower/wall

## requirements
### base requirements
-	Two robot arms that build a tower between them
  
### extra requirements
-	Bricks with different colors and shapes, and build the tower/wall with different patterns
-	Limited resources, after there are less than 5 bricks, one of the two robots wonder around to retrieve other bricks

### possible extras
-	Use the Frankie robot (mobile robotic arm)
-	Different bricks color order
-	Change block shapes
-	different shape blocks for different walls/drawing
-	one build, the other takes off the bricks at a faster speed
-	At the end of the task, the robot’s clap.
